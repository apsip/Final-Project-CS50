# Tip Tracker Web App
### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Overview:
This is 'Tip Tracker'. A simple, lightweight web application designed to help users(specifically
service industry workers) keep track of and manage their hours worked, cash tips and credit tips earned.
The application supports multiple jobs where the user can add, view, and analyze income data from their different
jobs.

### Description:
When accessing Tip Tracker a user is prompted to either log in or create an account. To create an account all you need to enter is your first and last name, email address and password. This information will be stored in a 
SQL Database that will be used to authenticate you at log-in and be referenced when saving future job and tip
data. After creating an account, you can now log-in. Once logged in, you will be at the home page where you can view current jobs, or add new ones. Once you do have a job added, you can then click on the job name and will be presented with two options: Log Income and View Income. When clicking on 'Log Income' you have the option to log income for 'Today' or 'Select Date' if you want to enter data from a previous date. After that you will be presented with a form that includes your hourly wage, cash tips, credit tips, start time, and end time. The application will calculate your hourly wage by multiplying the 'Hourly Wage' entered in the log income form by the amount of hours worked determined from your start and end time. Once submitted, the application will add everything up and you will be presented with a short summary of the income earned form the shift you entered.  And that's it! Later, you can go back and select the job you want to view income for. On this page, you will be presented with all the income earned from the current month. You can also filter the results by any specific month or year.
